Introduction The Air Quality Analysis Dashboard is an advanced data visualization tool designed to provide actionable insights into air pollution trends across multiple cities. Leveraging Power BI, this project transforms large datasets into an interactive platform that allows users to analyze key air pollutants, track air quality trends over time, and identify the most and least polluted cities. This report outlines the objectives, problem statement, features, methodology, results, and future enhancements of the project.

2. Project Objectives Develop an interactive and user-friendly dashboard to monitor air quality across various cities. Analyze key pollutants, including PM2.5, CO, SO2, NO, and AQI (Air Quality Index). Enable users to filter data dynamically using a city-wise slicer for focused insights. Visualize pollution trends over time through graphs and geospatial maps. Identify the top 3 most and least polluted cities for better comparative an alysis.

3. Problem Statement Rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to severe air pollution, impacting public health and the environment. Governments and organizations lack real-time, interactive tools to assess pollution trends effectively. Traditional data reports are static and difficult to interpret, making decision-making inefficient. There is a need for an intelligent dashboard that provides interactive, real-time visualization of pollution data for effective monitoring and policy-making.

 4.Results and Key Insights Identified the most polluted cities with consistently high AQI values. Determined the least polluted cities, setting benchmarks for air quality improvement. Observed seasonal variations in pollution levels, highlighting peak pollution months. Correlated different pollutants with AQI, revealing their impact on overall air quality. Provided real-time visualization, enabling better policy formulation and environmental strategies.
